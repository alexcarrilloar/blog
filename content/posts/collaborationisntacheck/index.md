When “leadership” means control, and “collaboration” is just a fancy way to say: 

_“Here’s what we’ve already decided, you’re just here so it looks like you were involved.”_

And I get it. I’ve done it too. 🙋‍♂️

There’s this subtle thing that happens in some teams. You walk into a meeting, maybe a sprint planning, maybe a refinement, and there is something already prepared. The architecture is drawn. The decisions are made. But the team is asked for “input.”

It’s not input. It’s a Collaboration Contract. **You’re not being asked to co-create; you’re being asked to agree.** 🤝

In one project, I had the chance to lead something that was really important for the company. I gathered requirements, met with users for days, took notes, explored edge cases… and then I went off to design the whole thing. I drew **The Diagram**.✨ You know the one: boxes, arrows, maybe some color-coded components if I was feeling fancy. It was clean. It was logical. It made sense. I was proud of it. I called a meeting, shared my screen, and presented it to the team.

One of my teammates, let’s call him Juan, sat quietly the entire time. He didn’t challenge anything. He didn’t ask questions. He nodded. And I took that as alignment. Days passed. Progress was slower than expected. I checked in with him and he said, “It’s okay, I’m just trying to understand what you had in mind.”

That’s the moment I realized what I’d missed.

Juan wasn’t confused; he was disconnected. He didn’t just learn by watching or listening. He needed to build it. To explore the trade-offs. To wrestle with the “what-if’s” and push back on the “maybe-not’s.” By handing him a finished solution, I had unintentionally left him out of the actual thinking process. I gave him something done, and asked him to implement it like it was a task, not a shared effort.

I mistook clarity for collaboration. 🤦‍♂️

Juan is one of the most dedicated and hardworking engineers I’ve had the chance to work with. But during the critical project, I made the mistake of skipping the part where he gets to think with me; where he gets to shape the direction, not just follow it. And because of that, he didn’t feel full ownership over the outcome. He wasn’t implementing our solution. He was implementing mine. 

When you lead with a locked-in⚽ plan, you might get passive agreement; but you lose the richness of different perspectives. The kind that catch blind spots, improve outcomes, and build real ownership.

Because when someone helps shape a decision, they’re way more likely to care about it. They’ll defend it. Improve it. **Fight for it**. 🔥

But if they’re just handed a diagram? They’ll nod, maybe ask a question or two, and then go back to whatever they were doing before.
That’s how teams end up shipping something no one’s really proud of. Or worse, something no one truly understands. 

It’s a lesson that’s stayed with me. It reminded me that if you want people to care deeply about something, you have to bring them in early. Not just to review the plan, but to help create it. That’s where real collaboration lives, not in neat presentations, but in the real work, the part where ideas are tested, questioned, and built.
