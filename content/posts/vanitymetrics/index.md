Someone asked me:  
_"Hey, can you accept my pull request? And if possible… could you travel back in time so the average resolution time doesn’t go up?"_ I laughed. But deep down, I knew I’d heard versions of that line _way_ too many times lately.

Somewhere along the way, we confused **metrics** with **meaning**. There’s this phrase floating around in the IT world: _“You can’t improve what you can’t measure.”_ And sure, it has its place. It helps us stay grounded, know where we are, and track progress. But I’ve been thinking more about Aristotle lately, specifically his idea of virtue being the balance between extremes. Not too little, not too much. Just right. (Thanks Mateus, [Mindshop](https://mindshop.cafe/) really helps). 💡

That’s when we fall into **_vanity metrics_** those slick, surface-level stats that feel good on a dashboard but don’t tell the **full story**. Like celebrating a PR merge time of 30 seconds without asking if anyone even read it. 

And let’s not forget the all-time favorite: **lines of code written**.  
Too few? Not productive, too many? Overengineering. So what's the “right” number? Maybe… zero. (Plot twist: what if I just cram the whole logic in a single line and call it a day?) Or the opposite, lots of blank lines, one variable declared per line. Done, I’ve “improved” my output. 😌

This is where **vanity metrics** sneak in the kind of numbers that _look_ good on dashboards but don’t actually reflect the health, impact, or quality of the work.  These metrics are easy to game, tempting to track, and dangerously misleading if we start basing decisions or evaluations on them. Because let’s be honest: developers will do _whatever it takes_ to “win” the metric, especially when the metric becomes the goal.

_“Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.”_ And I’ve lived it.  I’ve seen teams so focused on stats that they forgot what they were building. Engineers more worried about keeping their PR review time under 1 hour than giving thoughtful feedback. That’s how we lose sight of the **outcome**, the actual impact on users, on the business, on each other.

And speaking of outcomes, let me bring in a personal favorite: _Valorant_. 🎮  

It’s a tactical shooter where everyone obsesses over their **KDA** (Kills/Deaths/Assists). But here's the thing: you can have a great KDA and still lose the game if you ignore the **objective**. I’ve seen players with perfect stats camping in the corner like it’s their home, while the rest of the team is screaming: _“Enter to the site!”_

That’s what **vanity metrics** do, they turn talented people into campers, focused on the stats, not about winning the game. 🏆

Before you find yourself hovering over a pull request just to keep the chart looking green, or skipping a conversation because it might slow down the sprint velocity, take a breath; Metrics aren’t the enemy, but when we start performing _for_ them instead of learning _from_ them, we trade depth for decoration.

Because real progress doesn’t always fit in a graph. Sometimes it looks like a tough review, a refactor no one asked for, or a moment spent mentoring instead of merging.

In the end, ***a perfect dashboard means nothing if it comes at the cost of purpose***, no one wins a game just by looking good on paper, not in Valorant, and definitely not in software.
