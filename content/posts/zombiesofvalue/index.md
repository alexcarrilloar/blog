The other day, I was chatting with a friend who’s a Product Manager, and she recommended me the book “What Got You Here Won’t Get You There” by Marshall Goldsmith, and one idea that really stuck with me was the concept of “Adding Too Much Value.” It hit close to home because I’ve been there, and that idea has seriously shaped the way I work on a team.

When I was a junior engineer, I struggled with ownership. Even if I was technically assigned to a task, it rarely felt like it was mine. **Any idea I had would usually get polished or replaced before it could take real form.** The intention behind that feedback was good, to deliver the best possible result ✨, but the side effect? I never really built confidence in my own voice or felt the full weight of responsibility.

It’s tough to feel accountable for something you didn’t really build. And even harder to care deeply about it when you didn’t have space to shape it. That’s how well-intentioned advice or improvement suggestions can, without meaning to, silence emerging talent. 🤐

Now that I’ve gained more experience, I’ve caught myself falling into that same trap, jumping in too soon, offering advice before it’s needed, trying to “add value” at every turn. It’s easy to think you’re helping by offering best practices or a faster solution. After all, results matter. As one of my former managers used to say, **“De aquí sale para comer"** — (Work allows me to eat). But here’s the catch: even a small suggestion, meant to improve the outcome by just 5%, can chip away at someone’s motivation and sense of ownership.

I’ve started calling this behavior **“zomvalue”** or **"zombies of value"** like zombies🧟‍♂️, it’s a relentless pursuit of value delivery without stopping to ask: **at what cost?** These are the moments when team harmony gets overshadowed by the pressure to contribute, to optimize, to “make it better” regardless of who might get left behind in the process. This isn’t about never sharing ideas or staying silent when improvements matter. It’s about reading the room. About asking yourself if your comment, no matter how helpful, might shrink someone else’s sense of ownership.

One of the biggest takeaways from the book wasn’t about doing more good, but simply: stop being a **jerk**. It’s not always about stepping up, sometimes, it’s about stepping back and letting others step forward.

So the next time someone shares an idea they’re excited about, or a feature they want to take on, pause. Ask yourself: ***Is this a moment to teach, or a moment to support? Will my input help them grow, or just prove that I was right?***
