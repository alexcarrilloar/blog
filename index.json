[{"categories":null,"content":"Throughout my career as a Software Engineer, I’ve had the chance to face a wide range of software errors, from isolated cases to full system failures. It’s fascinating to observe how different people take different paths to reach the same destination: the root cause. But I want to talk about a behavior that, unfortunately, I see repeating itself over and over again when trying to find “the needle in the haystack.” In a collaborative work environment, it’s common for team members to approach you for help with a problem that has been unresolved for hours, days, or even weeks. ⏳ Once you start reviewing the code or the process in search of the error, you find different responses when asking key questions about the problem. The most common one (at least in my case) is: “That can’t be” 😠, and the times when that statement was wrong are far more frequent than the times it was true, which leads me to believe that at this point, a high level of stress or desperation was reached, often due to a trial-and-error approach. I believe that approach to problem-solving only adds unnecessary stress, making options seem limited. My takeaway is that you don’t need to reinvent the wheel. Although everyone follows their own experiences, it is possible to learn new ways of approaching even the most basic topics, such as troubleshooting. For example, learning about Systematic Debugging. In the end, I always remind myself that what happens is not magic, but a set of variables that lead to a specific result. Having patience and open-mindedness when solving problems is not only crucial, but it can also help you reach a higher level of collaboration and effectiveness within the team. And no, it’s not about confronting the person who wrote the code or the code itself; In the end, it’s just about figuring things out and fixing the problem, nothing else. 🔍 ","date":"2025-01-20","objectID":"/blog/posts/yesitispossible/:0:0","tags":["leadership","soft-skills"],"title":"Yes, it is possible","uri":"/blog/posts/yesitispossible/"}]
