            </div><p>Throughout my career as a Software Engineer, Iâ€™ve had the chance to face a wide range of software errors, from isolated cases to full system failures that,  if measured in financial impact, involve significant sums. This experience led me to create my own guide on the steps to take in order to identify the root cause of a problem. ðŸ’¡</p>
<p>Itâ€™s fascinating to observe how different people take different paths to reach the same destination: the root cause. However, today Iâ€™m not here to share that guide, but to talk about a behavior that, unfortunately, I see repeating itself over and over again when trying to find &ldquo;the needle in the haystack.&rdquo;</p>]]></description>
