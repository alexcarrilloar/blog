            </div><p>Last week, I went to the ophthalmologist to get my vision checked. You know, just the usual: reading tiny letters on a chart, and the doctor asking if &ldquo;this one or that one&rdquo; looks clearer. But midway through the appointment, something unexpected happened.</p>
<p>As he was examining my eyes, we started chatting. At one point, he asked what I do for a living. I mentioned I work in software development, and suddenly he seemed more curious, kind of like when someone realizes you might be able to fix that annoying tech problem theyâ€™ve been silently suffering with.</p>]]></description>
