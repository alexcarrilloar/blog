    <title>Zombies of Value: How Good Intentions Kills Ownership</title>

            </div><p>The other day, I was chatting with a friend who’s a Product Manager, and she recommended me the book “What Got You Here Won’t Get You There” by Marshall Goldsmith, and one idea that really stuck with me was the concept of “Adding Too Much Value.” It hit close to home because I’ve been there, and that idea has seriously shaped the way I work on a team.</p>
<p>When I was a junior engineer, I struggled with ownership. Even if I was technically assigned to a task, it rarely felt like it was mine. <strong>Any idea I had would usually get polished or replaced before it could take real form.</strong> The intention behind that feedback was good, to deliver the best possible result ✨, but the side effect? I never really built confidence in my own voice or felt the full weight of responsibility.</p>]]></description>

            </div><p>Throughout my career as a Software Engineer, I’ve had the chance to face a wide range of software errors, from isolated cases to full system failures.
It’s fascinating to observe how different people take different paths to reach the same destination: the root cause. But I want to talk about a behavior that, unfortunately, I see repeating itself over and over again when trying to find &ldquo;the needle in the haystack.&rdquo;</p>]]></description>
